Completed Research & Feasibility Analysis
Objective: This document confirms the feasibility of the Navajo Nation Governance Tracker POC by answering the questions from our "Research & Feasibility Sanity Check" using the detailed information provided in your research document.

Overall Conclusion: The deep research confirms that the project is highly feasible. The necessary data sources, while fragmented, are publicly accessible and machine-readable. The core challenges have been correctly identified, and the proposed technical solutions are well-suited to address them.

Phase 1: Data Source Verification & Scraping Feasibility — CONFIRMED

Your research confirms that the raw data is available and accessible.

Step 1.1: The "Living" Code Component

1.1.1: Base Code Location: Confirmed. The 2010 Navajo Nation Code is located at nnols.org/navajo-nation-code. It consists of four large, machine-readable PDF files.

1.1.2: Amendments Location: Confirmed. The official source for amendments is a summary page at nnols.org/navajo-nation-code/amendments/. This page lists resolution numbers but does not contain the full text. The full text of the amending resolutions must be scraped from their individual PDF documents, which are scattered across the Council and OLS websites.

1.1.3: Scraping Viability: Confirmed. The data exists in structured HTML lists and machine-readable PDFs. A scraping strategy combining a primary scrape of the legislation list from navajonationcouncil.org with a secondary, metadata-focused scrape of the DiBB system (dibb.nnols.org) is viable.

Step 1.2: The Bill & Council Tracker Component

1.2.1: Legislative Tracking System: Confirmed. dibb.nnols.org is the definitive system for rich metadata (sponsors, status, history). This must be used in tandem with navajonationcouncil.org, which serves as the primary source for the full-text PDF of the bills themselves.

1.2.2: Council Member Data: Confirmed, with complexity. The official roster is at navajonationcouncil.org/council/. However, your research correctly notes this source is often incomplete. A robust solution requires reconciling this data with official press releases and committee agendas to build a complete and accurate profile for each delegate, especially regarding committee assignments.

Step 1.3: The Judicial Branch Component

1.3.1: Supreme Court Opinions Location: Confirmed. The official repository is at courts.navajo-nsn.gov/supreme-court-opinions/. The archive contains machine-readable PDF opinions dating back to 2013. Critically, your research confirms that these opinions cite specific NNC statutes, making it feasible to programmatically link court cases to the laws they interpret.

Phase 2: Technical & Architectural Validation — CONFIRMED

Your research validates the proposed technical approach for processing and displaying the data.

Step 2.1: "Living Code" Logic: Confirmed. Your research in Section 2.2.2 outlines a sound methodology. The process will involve parsing the enacting language of resolutions with NLP/regex to identify target statutes, and then using a library like Python's difflib to compare the old and new text. This confirms that a "diff-able," version-controlled code is technically achievable.

Step 2.2: "Mind Map" Technology: Confirmed. Your research strongly advocates for a graph database (like Neo4j) over a traditional relational one. This aligns perfectly with the need for a "Mind Map" view. A graph model is the ideal technology for representing and querying the complex, interconnected relationships between delegates, bills, committees, and court cases.

Phase 3: Contextual & Competitive Analysis — CONFIRMED

Your research confirms the project's unique value proposition.

Step 3.1: Existing Solutions: Confirmed. Your research identified the "Diné Nihi Kéyah Project" as a non-governmental effort to compile amendments. However, this appears to be a manual, best-effort project. It validates the need for a solution but does not replicate our proposed feature set. There is no existing tool that offers the automated, AI-summarized, interconnected, and fully reconciled platform that our POC aims to build. The Governance Tracker would be a unique and significant improvement over any currently available resource.
